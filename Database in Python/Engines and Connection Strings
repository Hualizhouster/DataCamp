Import create_engine from the sqlalchemy module.
Using the create_engine() function, create an engine for a local file named census.sqlite with sqlite as the driver. Be sure to enclose the connection string within quotation marks.
Print the output from the .table_names() method on the engine.


coding:
##############
# Import create_engine
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Create an engine that connects to the census.sqlite file: engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///census.sqlite')

# Print table names
print(engine.table_names())
