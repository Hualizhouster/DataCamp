Use pd.concat() to concatenate g1800s, g1900s, and g2000s into one DataFrame called gapminder. Make sure you pass DataFrames to pd.concat() in the form of a list.
Print the shape and the head of the concatenated DataFrame.

# Concatenate the DataFrames row-wise
gapminder = pd.concat([g1800s,g1900s,g2000s])

# Print the shape of gapminder
print(gapminder.shape)

# Print the head of gapminder
print(gapminder.head())
