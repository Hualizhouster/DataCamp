# Using the function create_engine(), create an engine for the SQLite database Chinook.sqlite and assign it to the variable engine.
Use the pandas function read_sql_query() to assign to the variable df the DataFrame of results from the following query: select all records from the Employee table where the EmployeeId is greater than or equal to 6 and ordered by BirthDate (make sure to use WHERE and ORDER BY in this precise order).


Coding:

# We can solve this task in terms of the packages of sqlalchemy and pandas.

The 1st approach:

from sqlalchemy import connet_engine
import pandas as pd

engine = create_engine("sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite")
With connect_engine() as con:
    rs = con.execute("select * from employee where EmployeeId >= 6 order by BirthDate")
    df = pd.DataFrame(rs.fetchall())
    df.columns = rs.keys()
    
print(df.head())

The 2nd approach:

from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pandas as pd

engine = create_engine("sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite")

df = pd.read_sql_query("select * from employee where EmployeeId >= 6 order by BirthDate", engine)
print(df.head())
