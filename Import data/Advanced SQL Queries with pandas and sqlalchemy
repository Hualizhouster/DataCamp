coding:

from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pandas as pd

engine = create_engine("sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite")

# Execute query and store records in DataFrame: df
df = pd.read_sql_query("select * from PlaylistTrack INNER JOIN Track on PlaylistTrack.TrackId = Track.TrackId where Milliseconds < 250000", engine)

# Print head of DataFrame
print(df.head())
