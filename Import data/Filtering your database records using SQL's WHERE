# Complete the argument of create_engine() so that the engine for the SQLite database 'Chinook.sqlite' is created.
Execute the query that selects all records from the Employee table where 'EmployeeId' is greater than or equal to 6. Use the >= operator and assign the results to rs.
Apply the method fetchall() to rs in order to fetch all records in rs. Store them in the DataFrame df.
Using the rs object, set the DataFrame's column names to the corresponding names of the table columns.


Coding:

from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pandas as pd

# Create engine: engine
engine = create_engine("sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite")

# Open engine in context manager
# Perform query and save results to DataFrame: df
 with engine.connect() as con:
     rs = con.execute("select * from employee where EmployeeId >= 6")
     df = pd.DataFrame(rs.fetchall())
     df.columns = rs.keys()

# Print the head of the DataFrame df
print(df.head())


then Ordering your SQL records with ORDER BY BirthDate:

engine = create_engine("sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite")

with engine.connect() as con:
     rs = con.execute("select * from employee order by BirthDate")
     df = pd.DataFrame(rs.fetchall())
     df.columns = rs.keys()
print(df.head())
