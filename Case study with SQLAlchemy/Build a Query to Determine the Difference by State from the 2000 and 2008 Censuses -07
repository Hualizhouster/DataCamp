In this final exercise, you will write a query to calculate the states that changed the most in population. You will limit your query to display only the top 10 states.

INSTRUCTIONS
100XP
Build a statement to:
Select state.
Calculate the difference in population between 2008 (pop2008) and 2000 (pop2000).
Group the query by census.columns.state using the .group_by() method on stmt.
Order by 'pop_change' in descending order using the .order_by() method with the desc() function on 'pop_change'.
Limit the query to the top 10 states using the .limit() method.
Execute the query and store it as results.
Print the state and the population change for each result. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the result!

coding:

stmt = select([census.columns.state,
              (census.columns.pop2008-census.columns.pop2000).label('pop_change')
              ])

stmt = stmt.group_by(census.columns.state)

stmt = stmt.order_by(desc('pop_change'))

stmt = stmt.limit(10)
results = connection.execute(stmt).fetchall()

for result in results:
    print('{}:{}'.format(result.state, result.pop_change))
