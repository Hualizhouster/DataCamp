Write a for loop to iterate though csv_files:
In each iteration of the loop, read csv into a DataFrame called df.
After creating df, append it to the list frames using the .append() method.
Concatenate frames into a single DataFrame called uber.
Hit 'Submit Answer' to see the head and shape of the concatenated DataFrame!'





# Create an empty list: frames
frames = []

#  Iterate over csv_files
for csv in csv_files:

    #  Read csv into a DataFrame: df
    df = pd.read_csv(csv)
    
    # Append df to frames
    frames.append(df)

# Concatenate frames into a single DataFrame: uber
uber = pd.concat(frames)

# Print the shape of uber
print(uber.shape)
