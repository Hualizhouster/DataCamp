Import re.
Write a pattern that will find all the numbers in the following string: 'the recipe calls for 10 strawberries and 1 banana'. To do this:
Use the re.findall() function and pass it two arguments: the pattern, followed by the string.
\d is the pattern required to find digits. This should be followed with a + so that the previous element is matched one or more times. This ensures that 10 is viewed as one number and not as 1 and 0.
Print the matches to confirm that your regular expression found the values 10 and 1.
